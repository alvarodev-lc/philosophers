The Dining Philosopher Problem states that N philosophers seated around a circular table with a large bowl of spaghetti and one fork between each pair of philosopher. Each philosopher is doing one of the three things: eating, sleeping, thinking. While eating, they are not thinking or sleeping, while sleeping, they are not eating or thinking and of course, while thinking, they are not eating or sleeping. I should state that philosophers arenâ€™t aware of other philosophers status.
